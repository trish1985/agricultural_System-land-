        <p>Tomato prices in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, have significantly increased due to a shortage in supply.</p>
        <p>According to a Balitanghali report on Monday, tomatoes are now priced at P130 to P180 per kilo at the Sangitan Public Market</p>
        <p>The shortage has been linked to agricultural damage caused by tropical cyclones that struck the Philippines in 2024.</p>
        <p>In Metro Manila, tomato prices have also surged as retailers factored in additional costs. </p>
        <p>At the Marikina Public Market, tomatoes are being sold for up to P400 per kilo,</p>
        <p>making them more expensive than some pork cuts such as liempo, which is priced between P360 and P380 per kilo</p>
