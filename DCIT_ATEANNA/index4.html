        <p>The Department of Agriculture (DA) is taking proactive steps to prevent a potential egg shortage and price surge in the Philippines, Agriculture Secretary Francisco P. Tiu Laurel Jr. said on Friday.</p>
        
        <p>The initiative aims to address supply concerns stemming from last year’s industry losses and to avert a crisi</p>
       <p>While the Philippines has not experienced a widespread bird flu outbreak, Sec. Tiu Laurel cautioned that the country could face an egg supply shortage by April. In 2024, oversupply and weak demand drove egg prices down, leading many local producers to cull their layers. This significantly reduced the population of egg-laying hens, potentially impacting future supply</p>
       <p>To mitigate the risk, the DA is expediting the importation of egg-laying chickens and pushing for immediate approval of avian influenza vaccines by the Food and Drug Administration. The agency is also working to secure the P300 million requested by the National Livestock Program to fund vaccine testing, with the possibility of mass inoculation beginning as early as March.</p>
        <p>“We still have time, so there is a chance we could avert this,” Sec. Tiu Laurel said, urging financial institutions, including LandBank and the Development Bank of the Philippines, to provide funding to support the industry’s repopulation efforts .</p>
        <p>The DA’s swift action is intended to stabilize egg production and shield consumers from sharp price increases, ensuring food security in the coming months, he said. ### (photo by Gian Carlo Luague, DA-AFID)</p>
